  Project: Morse Code Tester
  Purpose: Inspired by my partner who suggested learning morse code for "secret" communication, I thought
  that it would be helpful to make a testing website that gives questions based off
  morse code that also has audio.

  Notes of what I have learned while doing this project:
  
  1. HTML: You can initialize a div with an id and class name with
  #idName.classname then tabbing. If you do it without a #, you set only class name
  you can also specify the element type for example do p.text or h1#bye

  2. CSS: The body of a page is also referred to as :root

  3. CSS: The * symbol selects all elements

  4. CSS: There is a property called disabled

  5. CSS: There is a property of cursor called not allowed where cursor can't press it
