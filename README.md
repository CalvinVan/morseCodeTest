# Morse Code Tester

## This project was based on this tutorial. Features that were kept were most of the general css, question validation feature, and high score page.

Inspired by a desire to learn Morse Code with my partner and to create an interactive experience for those who may want to test on their Morse Code knowledge, I created a website that provides a randomly generated multiple choice quiz that tests the user's knowledge on morse code that also keeps track of the user's score.

## Project Features
- Multiple-choice quiz testing on Morse Code
- Compatible on both computer and mobile
- Difficulty selector to promote faster learning through chunking
- Question type selector to promote more versatile learning
- High Score page to locally track the top 5 testing scores

## Future Features
- Morse Code difficulty mode based on sound
- Letter question difficulty mode based on text input
- Possibly a high score page that keeps track of the various difficulties rather than for all modes.
- A learn mode that breaks the sections into levels and forces you to get a 100% accuracy on the level to proceed.
